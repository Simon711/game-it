                          I wake up at 11 or 12 am, that's why I hate the 9am-5am job. I usually ship breakfast and go to the office.
                          Because I am the chief of business development, my main task is to search for creative ideas,
                          what and how collaboration with other company, make Pin Tea more exposed. Usually I sleep at 2 or 3 am,
                          sometimes at 4 am, due to scrolling Facebook, Tiktok searching for research on packaging designing.
                          How to make the business much better, more powerful and stronger. Our brain is active at midnight.

                        <h5><strong>How do you manage your stress? </strong></h5>
                        <h6 class="text-justify">
                          When I have stress, I don’t like to be distracted. I like to be alone a lot on my own. Because of a
                          few things, I have a tea set to make tea. I just sit there alone. Just like a very quiet moment for
                          me, then just drink some tea, make some tea like we called KungFu tea. I just relieve all my stress,
                          maybe I can listen to some music. And one more thing, the favorite way to help me to relieve stress
                          is to drive to Genting, as fast as I can. So whenever my favorite sport is not sky avenue or casino
                          because I'm not a gambler. When I went to Genting, there was a temperature write 18° or what, from
                          there we drove down the first corner and the first corner there have a blank spot, so I always stop
                          my car there. I stop my car there then step down then the view is like I can look all the way all KL
                          cities. From standing there I can release my stress, because when I’m standing there I will like stepping
                          out from my city already. So I can see everything is very small. So when I have stress, what is the stress
                          caused? When we have stress, that thing will enlarge, so negativity in your brain will like exploring
                          already so every day your daily life will be distracted. So when I step out there, when I go to the hilltop,
                          go to my favorite sport, when I look at the city, the city is so small, I’m thinking the thing that
                          bother me that are trying to get in way is smaller than the city, so why do I care it, just go away.
                          This is how I release my stress.

                        <h5><strong>What's your favorite aspect of being an entrepreneur?</strong></h5>
                        <h6 class="text-justify">
                          I can say it is a challenge and my time, because the challenge in entrepreneurship is not easy, because
                          the world is very cruel. We want to collaborate with the other company and the other company wants to
                          collaborate with us are two different things. If we want to collaborate with other companies, they want
                          to see our profile, attitude. If someone wants to collaborate with us, we need to look into their things,
                          this is quite challenging for me, because not every company likes our culture, this is the truth. Most of
                          them like us, because we are very free, we are young, we are lively, we can negotiate with the boss, we can
                          also go anywhere we like. So, the aspect that I like the most is the challenge. Like myself, I like challenges
                          the most, everything I'm doing now is challenging, so I like my job. The other aspect is time, because I can
                          control my time freely, I can sleep all the way until 12 noon, then if I want to wake, then I wake up and go
                          to the office. After work, I can brainstorm, meet, then I can go back home and spend time with my family.

                        <h6 class="text-justify">
                          One of the things I want to tell you is that, normally, we think doing business is very profitable. Businessmen
                          can always drive a good car, that is nonsense I tell you, that is a lie. Instead, my crews are driving a better
                          car than me, like GTR and Ferrari to my shop. So what is my expectation during my business? In this journey,
                          I enjoy every particular moment. The best thing about entrepreneurship is I can observe my business growth.
                          This is very interesting. The reason is no matter how big the achievement, for example, opening a new shop is
                          one of an achievement, actually the achievement in the market is very small. For me, I enjoy starting a business
                          by opening a shop. I also solve many problems during my business. Next, I also like to spend my time with my
                          partner, because our working time is very free. Although we need to complete our tasks in time, every one of us
                          works differently, not following company regulation. A company usually has constant meetings and writing reports,
                          but we don’t need that. When we have a project to do with, we just need to go anywhere we want. Let’s say we want
                          to go to some food restaurant, so we just go straight away and enjoy our trip. It could be considered 90% of the
                          process that we are playing, and the left is the discussion. What we have done is we are learning while playing.

                          In the different part of view, Mr. David thought that different sizes of business get their own way, not every
                          startup business needs to have a huge start-up capital. People can start up what they like from a very small
                          capital. For fresh graduates, they need to clear out their mind first, are they ready to jump up from their
                          comfort zone or not. They should always have a backup plan and continue learning. The most important thing
                          is to enjoy the whole journey.

            <p class="text-justify">From the industrial talk by 1 of the founders of Pin Tea Malaysia – Mr David on 14th June 2022, 8:30 pm to 9:30 pm, 
              at Webex online meeting platform. I learned how they started up their business. He is a diploma graduate from Inti College, 
              Malaysia, and last he and his partners decided to start their own business with Pin Tea Malaysia. He does not like 9 to 6 work, 
              although it pays more, he and his partners faced conflict during the business. Still, it is really ordinary when working in a 
              team, everyone has different opinions, ideas and thoughts, try to solve them together and talk to each other instead of just 
              keeping silent. The level of misunderstanding or argument will be increased. His diploma education is not being helpful or 
              useful to him if he could travel back to the timeframe before he furthered his study to diploma level, he said he would not 
              go for it, he would start his business journey directly. Furthermore, by inspiration from Mr David, I have learned the 
              difficulty of start-up a journey as a business, it is not as easy as I thought, and need to grab the opportunity, have 
              the ability of time management, patience, passion, and responsibility. Besides, from Mr David’s talk, he traveled a lot, 
              he went to China, he got a culture shock because he saw how advanced is China, developed rapidly, that was a great experience 
              for him, he learned from Chinese in China how they operate their business successfully. Therefore, I think we cannot only 
              just stay within our comfort zone, we must take our first step, try to look around the world, we could have a different perspective. 
              Other than that, I also learned that we have to be patient when facing conflict among team members, keeping silent will 
              not be the best decision, it might bring a worse situation. Try to communicate with them, figure out the solution, think 
              about the causes, and make the best decision for each of the team members. In the future, I know how to handle 
              in-team conflict, even currently studying, we have our own time and might have some conflict. Besides, I have to be courageous 
              to step out of the first step, fearless of failure in a critical situation, failure never makes you fail, but fear does.

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">Clive Lai Yi Cheng</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">The industry that we interviewed is Pin Tea Malaysia, which is founded by Mr. David and his team. 
              He was giving a speech from 8.30pm until 9.30pm on June 14th, 2022. After that, we had our interview session after the 
              speech for about an hour. Mr. David was giving an extraordinary and interesting sharing during the interview session. 
              The most important thing that I have learnt is the ways to release stress. Mr. David mentioned that he would like to 
              drink tea and listen to music when he is alone, because he does not like to be distracted. The other way is he likes 
              to drive away from the city area and has a chill with tourist attractions such as Genting Highland. During his tour 
              to Genting Highland, he stopped his car at the blind spot and that particular place could get the view of KL. He also 
              experienced the cold of Genting Highland. Thus, these methods impressed me to get rid of the stress as a businessman. 
              Moreover, I am also doing similar ways to release stress as Mr. David too. When I have a lot of work in my todo list, 
              I will try to release the burden by listening to music, also trying to stay in a cool environment or get a bath just 
              like staying in Genting Highland. Mr. David also impressed me that he is enjoying every particular moment in his business 
              life. The interesting thing is he does not really have the satisfaction from the profit brought by the business, even 
              his crew and customers have a better automobile and house. But he enjoys the time together with his partner. Their 
              working time is very free, they can have a kick start meeting anytime they want. They also travel anywhere and try 
              the food around the world as a way of research. I like his lifestyle of spending time together with friends and also 
              working at the same time. From his lesson, I can also spend my time together with my classmate to complete the 
              assignment together. We also can plan for a trip to spend our leisure time together.

            <p class="text-justify">Our invited speaker for the industry talk is Mr. David Chew. One of the founders of Pin Tea
              Malaysia. The presentation was held on June 14, 2022 from 8:30pm to 9:30pm. This event is an online event by using 
              webex platform. After Mr. David finished his speech, we invited him to do a short interview. Mr David shared many of 
              his own stories during his speech. I was inspired a lot by his speech. I learned that the brand Pin tea Malaysia was 
              created by him and 3 other friends. I also learned about the difficulties and hardships that Mr. david said in his 
              entrepreneurial journey. Mr David often travels to different places to experience different cultural shocks. He then 
              learns from the locals and how they have managed to run his business successfully. Since Pin Tea Malaysia was co-created 
              by 4 people, there was bound to be some friction between them in the process of starting the company. With Mr David's 
              sharing, I learned that we have to be patient in the face of friction between members, try to communicate with them, 
              and work with members to find solutions and make the best decision. Because staying silent all the time is not a good 
              solution to a problem. What impressed me most in the interviews that followed was Mr David's way of managing his emotions. 
              When facing pressure, Mr. David likes to drink tea and listen to music quietly, or he will drive to Genting alone to 
              look at the whole view of Kuala Lumpur. The reason this topic strikes me so much is that I also like to be alone when 
              I'm feeling really stressed. Listen to the songs quietly and relax, and then continue to face the next challenge with 
              a good attitude.

              Mr David was giving a very lively talk that evening, he has shown us the spirit of a teenager and the dedication to be
              successful in entrepreneurship. He shared to us about how much he does not like to study, but he is very dedicated to be 
              successful, not to  be a loser. From this experience, I had learnt that the drive to finish a task is the key to success. 
              Not only that, I also like the way he releases his stress. He shared that he likes to drive up the Genting Highland and 
              stop by the mountainside and look at Kuala Lumpur City. He says he is able to see through the whole city, even though the 
              city is quite huge, then his problems are just not the huge as he thinks. I like the positivity which is given out by him, 
              he shows me a sight of looking at things in real life. In the end I really hope that one day I could meet up with him again 
              and share the same hobbies with him and get close to him. He could be the model for all the teenagers who want to start up
              their business. I believe that he will be really willing to help us up and share his experience with us again.

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">Siah Weng Tze</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">After having the industrial talk with Mr. David from Pin Tea Malaysia, I gained a lot of new knowledge 
              regarding this entrepreneurship field. It tended to make me think back to what I wanted the most in my life? Was it freedom, 
              or a stable income? Mr. David shared with us how he found Pin Tea together with his friend. I was inspired by his attitude 
              where he would give all in something that he really looked forward to. He and his friend were willing to travel all the way 
              to China and Taiwan to get the idea, choose their products raw material wisely and did the market research. It was wonderful 
              when people get to enjoy what they are doing although it was a tough journey.This started to make me feel that the road I 
              chose right now was the one that I was really interested in? Was it because I had no guts to go for the field that I was 
              willing to give all of myself in? Was it because I refused to step out of my comfort zone? After listening to Mr. David's speech, 
              I gained more confidence to think properly. What was the future that 
              I really looked into? One thing that I learnt from him was that we should never give up no matter how tough the road in 
              front of us as long as it was the road that we wanted to. As long as we did not regret it when we think back on the journey 
              in the future.The successful story of Mr. David did inspire me a lot in the terms of physically and mentally. Physically, 
              I was inspired by his learning attitude that learn all the way until now even though he was at the entrepreneur level. 
              This reflected that learning was important and was not the task in university life only. Mentally, his guts and his desperation 
              were the ones I was interested in. He did not care about whether he had the capital for a startup or not, he did not care about 
              whether he had the knowledge to start up the business or not, he just made his idea into action, which was the most important 
              key feature. Nowadays, people always start at dreaming and end at dreaming, they rarely make their idea into action. 
              In conclusion, it was a great talk and I appreciated Mr. David for giving such a knowledgeable session for free.
